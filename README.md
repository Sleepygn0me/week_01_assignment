# week_01_assignment

Reflectiion:

For this project I wanted to use the example site as a template as I am not confident with css so as such I felt trying to match the lay out of that site would give me a more directed goal and something to try and aim for.

As required by the assingment brief I believe that I ensured each section was enclosed is the correct semantic tags and that I had a good use of semantic and non-semantic elements, as such I included the <header>,<nav> and <footer> tags as reqested in the brief.

I used the background image url tags in css in order to ensure that the content was displayed correctly as I am not confident in css I heavly relied on google to try and find ways to implement the ideas I had with me constantly refering to w3 schools css tricks and the mdn web doc sites in order to ensure that the site worked.

while writing this reflection I realised that I had missed one of the requiremnents of the brief which was to use absolute positioning to overlay text as such revisitied my css and found a way to implement the required absolute position while doing this I found that the css I wrot for the title class no longer seemed to make any changes as such I chose to remove that part of the css.

the main bugs I encounterd while creationg this site where errors with getting the images to fit correctly on the site, however I managed to find a way to fix them and get them to display correctly with a new class applied to all the section images that allowed them to display correctly.

while I feel that I have developed a site that fits the brief I realised that I need to further increase my understanding of css as I feel that I got lost on what to do frequently, and that though I got the site to work and solved the issues I encountered I don't have a good understanding of what the issues where or why the fix worked.Though my understanding of css did improve over this assignment I still feel that it is lacking, as such I intend to do further reading on css so that I dont have to overly rely on outside resources and that when I do I have a good understanding on what the issue is what caused it and why the fix worked.
